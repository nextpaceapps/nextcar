NextCar — monorepo for a used-vehicle dealership platform (public catalogue, admin panel, backend API, shared types) backed by Firebase.

## Project

- Firebase: `nextcar-83e67`
- GitHub: `nextpaceapps/nextcar`

## Working Process

- **Always create a new branch** before starting any new task or issue (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/issue-name`).
- **No AI/editor attribution** — never add any of the following to commits or PRs:
  - In commit messages: no trailers or lines such as `Made-with: Cursor`, `Co-authored-by: Cursor`, `Generated-by: AI`, or any variant (e.g. "made by Cursor", "generated by AI").
  - In PR titles or descriptions: no mention of Cursor, AI, or similar tools.
  - If the editor adds such a trailer automatically, remove it before committing (e.g. amend the commit or use `git commit` from the terminal with a plain message).

## Tooling

```bash
npm run dev:frontend          # Customer site       :5173
npm run dev:admin             # Admin panel         :5174
npm run dev:backend           # Express API         :5001
npx firebase emulators:start  # Auth/Firestore/Storage emulators
npm run build                 # Build all workspaces
```

## Key Invariants

- Types are **derived from Zod schemas** — see `docs/CONVENTIONS.md`.
- Collection names use the **shared `COLLECTIONS` constant** — never hardcode.
- Documents use **soft delete** (`deleted: true`) — never remove.
- Queries must filter **`deleted == false`** — never return deleted documents.
- Composite indexes must exist for any query combining **`where()` + `orderBy()`**.
- Security rules are **temporarily open** — see `docs/SECURITY.md`.
